            <div class="testimonial-item">
                <p>"We hired DREAMCRAFT to build a retaining wall as part of a new build in Fallbrook, CA. Abraham and his team did an outstanding job. Their communication skills, dedication, and effort were nothing short of outstanding. Abraham did a great job with pricing and stayed well within the quoted price, which was extremely reasonable. We would definitely hire DREAMCRAFT for future projects and would highly recommend that if you have a project, call Abraham at DREAMCRAFT and get a quote. You will not regret it." - Jay and Lorena Fitzpatrick from Google</p>

                <p>"Had Abraham and his crew do the foundation and retaining wall for our 1200sf ADU, 500sf garage, and 750sf workshop. All in all 125 yards of concrete from about 13 trucks. The guys were great, will def be calling them again when itâ€™s time for the driveway/hard scape." - Jared from Google</p>

                <p>"After contacting several concrete contractors, the DreamCraft, Inc. provided us with the most comprehensive and professional overview of the project; the owner provided a very professional scope of work to be submitted to HOA. The crew could not have been more professional, courteous, and informative. They left our property looking clean, and the concrete work was very well done. We asked for some altercations to the original work, which was done with very minimal trouble. We would highly recommend DreamCraft, Inc. and would definitely use their services in the future." - Ozgur from Google</p>
